# Cavu Tech Test

Vue.js 2 app built using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## Setup notes

Clone the repo, then `npm install`, followed by `npm run serve` to start up a local server.

## External packages

[Sass] (https://sass-lang.com/) as a css pre-processor.
[Normalize.css] (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to help with consistent cross-browser styling.
[Axios] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for the API call.
[uuid] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) to quickly generate unique IDs.
[Bulma] (https://bulma.io/) for some ready-made syling for the form.

## Other notes

Given more time, I would've liked to add some unit testing using Jest, however I'm still learning about testing so didn't get a chance to add that. I haven't matched the design in a pixel-perfect way, it's pretty close and works reponsively, although with more time I could have done a bit of a better job.
